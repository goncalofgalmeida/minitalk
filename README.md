[//]: # (Add screenshot of project execution)

##  Overview
Minitalk is a project from 42 that focuses on interprocess communication (IPC) using UNIX signals. The objective is to create a client-server program where the client sends a string to the server, which then prints it on the standard output.

##  Features

- Implement a client and a server using signals (`SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`).
- Send and receive messages between processes.
- Handle signals correctly to ensure proper communication.
- Ensure robustness and reliability in message transmission.
